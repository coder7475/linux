# NMAP

`nmap` - Network exploration tool and security/port scanner

## Syntax

```bash
nmap [<Scan Type>...] [ <Options> ] { <target Specification> }
```

## Description

- Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing.
- Designed to scan large networks quickly but also works on single hosts.
- Uses raw IP packets to:
  - Identify available hosts on a network.
  - Discover services (application names and versions) running on hosts.
  - Detect operating systems and their versions.
  - Identify packet filters or firewalls.
- Commonly used for security audits and routine tasks like:
  - Network inventory.
  - Managing service upgrade schedules.
  - Monitoring host or service uptime.
- Output includes a list of scanned targets with detailed information.
- Key output component is the "interesting ports table," which shows:
  - Port number and protocol.
  - Service name.
  - Port state (open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered).
- Can also provide additional details, such as:
  - Reverse DNS names.
  - Operating system guesses.
  - Device types.
  - MAC addresses.

## Examples

A representative Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
```

Here, the flags:
`-A`: flag is to enable OS and version detection, script running and traceroute
`-T4`: Fater Execution

Output for this command:

```bash

## Host Discovery in Network Reconnaissance

Host discovery is a crucial step in network reconnaissance, aimed at identifying active hosts within a network. Nmap offers various methods to perform host discovery effectively:

- **Purpose of Host Discovery**:

  - Reduces large IP ranges to a manageable list of active or interesting hosts.
  - Avoids scanning every port on every IP address, which is slow and often unnecessary.
  - The definition of an "interesting" host varies based on the scan's purpose (e.g., security audits vs. network administration).

- **Nmap Host Discovery Options**:

  - Host discovery is often called a "ping scan," but it encompasses more than just ICMP echo requests.
  - Default probes include:
    - **ICMP Echo Request**
    - **TCP SYN** to port 443
    - **TCP ACK** to port 80
    - **ICMP Timestamp Request** (omitted for IPv6)
  - For local networks, Nmap defaults to **ARP** (for IPv4) and **Neighbor Discovery** (for IPv6) scans, as they are faster and more effective.

- **Key Host Discovery Techniques**:

  - **-sL (List Scan)**: Lists each host in the specified network without sending any packets. Useful for verifying target IP addresses.
  - **-sn (No Port Scan)**: Performs host discovery only, without port scanning. It helps in light reconnaissance and network monitoring.
  - **-Pn (No Ping)**: Skips the host discovery stage and assumes all specified IPs are active, leading to a more exhaustive and potentially slower scan.

- **Advanced Probes for Host Discovery**:

  - **TCP SYN Ping (-PS)**: Sends a SYN packet to specified ports. Responses indicate the host is up.
  - **TCP ACK Ping (-PA)**: Sends an ACK packet, often used to bypass stateless firewalls.
  - **UDP Ping (-PU)**: Sends UDP packets to specified ports. Effective against firewalls that filter TCP but not UDP.
  - **SCTP INIT Ping (-PY)**: Sends an SCTP INIT chunk to probe hosts, useful for networks supporting SCTP.
  - **ICMP Ping Types (-PE, -PP, -PM)**: Utilizes various ICMP packets (Echo, Timestamp, Address Mask requests) to determine host availability.
  - **IP Protocol Ping (-PO)**: Sends packets with specific IP protocol numbers to identify active hosts.

- **Special Considerations**:

  - **--disable-arp-ping**: Disables ARP or Neighbor Discovery on local networks, useful in environments with proxy ARP.
  - **--discovery-ignore-rst**: Ignores TCP reset replies which might be spoofed by firewalls to conceal inactive hosts.
  - **--traceroute**: Performs a traceroute to discover the path to a host, useful for mapping network topology.

- **Usage Recommendations**:
  - Combine multiple probe types for better results against strict firewalls.
  - Use ARP or Neighbor Discovery for faster, more accurate results on local networks.
  - Opt for more intrusive or exhaustive probes when higher levels of detail or accuracy are needed.

Nmapâ€™s host discovery options are highly customizable, allowing users to fine-tune their scans according to specific network reconnaissance needs.

## Port Scanning Basics

Port scanning is a core function of Nmap, identifying the status of 1,000 TCP ports on a target host using a simple command: `nmap <target>`. Unlike traditional port scanners that categorize ports as either open or closed, Nmap provides more granularity by classifying ports into six distinct states:

- **Open**: An application is actively accepting connections on this port. This is the primary interest of port scanning, as open ports can indicate services available for exploitation or legitimate use.

- **Closed**: The port is accessible, but no application is listening. Closed ports can still provide useful information for host discovery and OS detection. Administrators might block these ports with firewalls, changing their state to filtered.

- **Filtered**: Nmap cannot determine if the port is open because packet filtering (from firewalls or routers) prevents probes from reaching it. This state provides minimal information and slows down scans due to retries.

- **Unfiltered**: The port is accessible, but Nmap cannot determine if it is open or closed. This state is identified primarily through ACK scans and can require further scanning to clarify the port's status.

- **Open|Filtered**: Nmap cannot discern whether a port is open or filtered, often due to a lack of response from the target. This state is common in UDP, IP protocol, and certain TCP scan types (e.g., FIN, NULL, Xmas).

- **Closed|Filtered**: Nmap is unable to decide if a port is closed or filtered. This rare state is typically identified through the IP ID idle scan.

These port states help administrators and security professionals understand the accessibility and potential vulnerabilities of networked systems, guiding further actions like firewall configuration or deeper scans.
