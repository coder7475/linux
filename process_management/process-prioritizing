** Linux controls priority through a value called ```niceness``` **

High Priority ~= Less Nice
Low  Priority ~= Nice

NICE (NI) - top, htop

# NI Ranges

High Priority = -19/-20
Low Priority  = +19/+20

# Set Nice value at the start of program

nice -n 15 command_to_execute

# Alter nice value of program that is already executing

renice 0 PID_to_prioritize
